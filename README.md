# declutterr

A new Flutter project.

Declutter is a mobile application responsible for scheduling tasks ,
You can enter specific task in a form of todo list with notification to remind you of what you have scheduled.

The codes for this application was all written by me using the flutter package written with Dart language. You can use an Android studio application or visual studio application to develop this application.
Thank you
